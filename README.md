# MERN-stack-exercise
This is a practice for MERN full stack. I'll create a to-do exercise tracker website using the MERN stack.


### Introduction
- The `MERN` stack consists of `MongoDB`, `Express`, `React/Redux`, and `Node.js`. The MERN stack is one of the most popular JavaScript stacks for building modern single-page web applications.
- In this tutorial, you will build a todo application that uses a **RESTful API**, which you will also build later in this tutorial.


### Prerequisites
- Install `node`
- Execute $ `npm init` to create a package.json file


### Node Server Setup
- To run our javascript code on the backend we need to spin up a server that will compile our code. The server can be created in two ways: first is to use the built in http module in node; second is to make use of the expressjs framework.
- Execute $ `npm install express`
  + [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) is a nodejs HTTP framework that handles a lot of things out of the box and requires very little code to create fully functional RESTful APIs.
- Execute $ `npm install dotenv`
  + [dotenv.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) allows you to load environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`.
- Create a file `index.js` as a Node.js server's entry point.
- This snipped from the code above helps handle CORS related issues that you might face when trying to access the api from different domains during development and testing.
  + ```javascript 
      app.use((req, res, next) => {
        res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");
        res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept");
        next();
      });
    ```
- Itâ€™s time to start our server to see if it works. If every thing goes well, you should see **Server running on port 5000** in your terminal.
  + Execute $ `node index.js`


### Routes
- There are three things that the app needs to do. For each task, we need to create routes that will define various endpoints that the todo app will depend on
  + create a task
  + view all tasks
  + delete a completed task.
- Create a folder `routes/`
  + $ `mkdir routes/`
  + $ `cd routes/`
  + then create an file `api.js`
- Reference to Express.js's Router object
  + [express.Router([options])](https://expressjs.com/en/5x/api.html#express.router)
  + [Express Router object](https://expressjs.com/en/5x/api.html#router)
